# Bucketlist

An exercise from Lexicon (education) in creating a bucketlist application for users to fill out, using arrays, array methods, objects, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

Programming language: JavaScript.

## Challenges 

This was my first JavaScript project in quite some time. My biggest challenge was giving users the opportunity to categorize different activities and filter between them. 

## Wish List

- Improve styling.
- Adjust alignment for different elements.
- Change fonts and styling for the dropdowns.
- Make the application responsive.
- Ensure the application follows accessibility guidelines.

## If I Could Do This All Over Again

- Focus on identifying challenges faster and addressing them promptly.
